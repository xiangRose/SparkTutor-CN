"""
M&M Candy Count Analysis - Starter Code

Implement the `mnm_analysis` function that:
1. Reads a CSV file with columns: State, Color, Count
2. Groups by State and Color, sums the Count column
3. Orders by the sum in descending order
4. Filters for California ('CA') only
5. Returns the California-only DataFrame

Based on the M&M count example from Learning Spark.
